# Client Profiles Export Script

This script retrieves client profiles from the Trulioo API and saves each profile as a JSON file. It's designed to work with paginated endpoints, ensuring that all client profiles are collected and stored in a specified directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install via `pip install requests`)

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. Set up your API token by replacing `'YOUR_API_TOKEN'` in the script with your actual API token.

4. Ensure that the output directory (`client_profiles`) is writable or update the directory path if necessary.

## Usage

To run the script, execute:

```bash
python client_profiles_export.py
```

The script will:

1. Fetch client IDs through paginated requests to the Trulioo API.
2. Retrieve profile details for each client.
3. Save each profile as a JSON file in the `client_profiles` folder.

## Configuration

- **API_TOKEN**: Replace `'YOUR_API_TOKEN'` in the script with your API token.
- **BASE_URL**: Set to the base URL of the Trulioo API.
- **output_folder**: The folder where JSON files will be saved. By default, it's set to `client_profiles`.

## Logging

The script logs progress, including:

- The number of client IDs fetched per page.
- Status of each profile retrieval.
- Progress of saving profiles.

Logs are displayed in the console with timestamps and log levels (INFO for general updates and ERROR for issues).

## Error Handling

If the script encounters a failed request (non-200 response), it logs an error message but continues with the next page or profile. Failed profile fetches are logged with the client ID and error status code.

## Optional Features

- **Rate Limiting**: To avoid being rate-limited by the API, you may uncomment the `time.sleep(1)` lines to introduce a delay between requests.

## Example Output

For each client ID, a JSON file will be saved in `client_profiles` with the filename format `{client_id}.json`.

Example structure for a saved profile JSON file:

```json
{
    "client_id": "12345",
    "profile": {
        // Profile details here
    }
}
```
